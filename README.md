# MRU Tab Cycler

MRU Tab Cycler is a Chrome extension that enables keyboard-based tab switching in **Most Recently Used (MRU)** order — similar to `Alt+Tab` behavior for applications.

Chrome’s default tab switching is linear (`Ctrl+Tab`), but this extension gives you back-and-forth navigation between your most recently used tabs.

## Features

- Switch to your last-used tab with a single keyboard shortcut
- Tracks tab focus in real time
- Toggle repeatedly between your two most recent tabs
- Does not require any external APIs or cloud services

## Shortcut

- Default: `Ctrl + Shift + 1`
- You can customize it at: `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
